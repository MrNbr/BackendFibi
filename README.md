# FIBI REST API #
This is the REST API used for HackUpc project for iThink, in where me and Eric Lopez try to build a new mobile application for students, where you can schedule classes with other students using some virtual coins. 
This REST API is built using Java, SpringBoot (with JPA, Hibernate) and DBMS PostgreSQL
